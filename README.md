# Java-OOP-Mini-Project

Description: 
This is a game called rock,paper,scissors created with Java.


Feature Requirements:
1. Have a main menu with options to enter 2 players or vs. computer.
2. If the user enters 2 players, they should be able to play rock–paper–scissors against a human competitor.
3. If the user enters vs. computer, they should be able to play against the computer.
4. When the game is over, the winner should be declared.

Technical Requirements:
1. Use classes to remove repetitive parts of code, and create an abstract Player class to manage the state of the player (if they won or lost, how many points they have, what move they made).  
2. Handle invalid user input.  
3. Handle incorrect capitalization of otherwise valid user input ("rock," "Rock," "RoCk," "ROCK," and more).
4. Each class (including a Player class) should have methods associated with it and be instantiated as an object (as opposed to a singleton or an interface).
5. Use public, private, and static variables, methods, and members within classes appropriately.
6. Incorporate exception handling to make sure your game crashes gracefully if it receives bad input.
7. Get standard input with Java using a Scanner, or use Processing to get mouse, keyboard, or other input.
8. Use arrays or array lists to store game history (if applicable).


Main Takeaways from Project:
1. Debugging in Intelliji was very helpful - was able to point of out any minor errors(typos,syntax,etc) that could prevent game from running
2. Was able to get a better grasp of object oriented programming
3. The importance of adaptability as Software Developer - shifting between two different languages.


Technologies/IDEs used: Intelliji, Java, Github
